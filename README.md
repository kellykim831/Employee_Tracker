# Employee_Tracker

 ## Description 
The MySQL Employee Tracker assignment was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
<br> 
The command-line application that I created allows the user to:

 1) Add departments, roles, employees 
 
 2) View departments, roles, employees
 
 3) Update employee roles
 
 4) Delete Employees
 
## Process
  The first step was to install node and the dependencies were MySQL, Inquirer and Console.table. I worked on connecting the MySQL database and perform the queries with the MySQL NPM package. I also used InquirerJS NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line. The console.table was used to print MySQL rows to the console and I created a seed.sql to pre-populate my database. This project was a bit challenging as the code was extremely long, but once I got an understanding of the code it was rewarding to see how the application played out. Please see below for some snippets:
